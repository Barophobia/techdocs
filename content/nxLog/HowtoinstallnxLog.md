# How to install NXLog

### Windows

Download NXLog from the website - [NXLog Downloads](https://nxlog.co/products/nxlog-community-edition/download)

Install using the .exe you just downloaded, if you choose a custom install path make sure you remember where it is.

Once you have configured the nxlog.conf start the nxlog service in the services applet.

If you have any issues there is a log file in the INSTALL_PATH\data\nxlog.txt this should give some information on what the issue is.
