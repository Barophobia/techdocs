# Maintaining a Linux Server

## Keep packages up to date

All Linux distributions use package managers to easily be able to install and update packages without having to manually download them. 

On debian the package manager is apt.

```
apt update
apt upgrade
```

Keeping the server up to date should be minimum maintenance required for your server as not only do up to date packages often offer more features but they also fix security bugs and vulnerabilities.
