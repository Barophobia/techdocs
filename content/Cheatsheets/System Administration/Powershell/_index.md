# Powershell

a lot of powershell commands have aliases that are similar to linux.

Basic

```
ls              # Shows current directory
cd <DIRECTORY>  # Change directory to specified directory
mkdir <NEWDIRECTORYNAME> # Create a new folder
copy <FILETOCOPY> <PATHTOCOPYTO>    # Copy a folder/file to a different place
move <FILETOMOVE> <PATHTOCOPYTO>    # Move a folder/file to a different place
rm <FILETOREMOVE>   # Remove a file 
```
